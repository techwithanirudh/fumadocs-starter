## Introduction

Large language models waste tokens crawling HTML, JS, and site chrome. These endpoints expose clean, text-only snapshots of your docs so agents can ingest them efficiently without scraping.

1. **`/llms.txt`**: a concise sitemap with titles, URLs, and summaries
2. **`/llms-full.txt`**: a Markdown dump of every document except the API reference
3. **`/llms.mdx/*`**: the raw MDX/Markdown content of a requested page with `text/markdown`

## `/llms.txt`

- Lists each section and page in your documentation (grouped by top-level category names)
- Includes optional one-line descriptions from frontmatter
- No boilerplate or styling, just the outline

```md
# Docs

## API Reference

- [Get museum hours](/docs/api-reference/operations/getMuseumHours): Get upcoming museum operating hours.
- [Buy museum tickets](/docs/api-reference/tickets/buyMuseumTickets): Purchase museum tickets for general entry or special events.

## Home

- [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart): Start building awesome documentation in under 5 minutes
```

This file is generated at the root of your deployed site, enabling agents to discover it at `https://<your-domain>/llms.txt`.

## `/llms-full.txt`

- Concatenates the raw MDX/Markdown of every page **except** `content/docs/api-reference/**/*` to keep the payload reasonable
- Preserves headings, paragraphs, code samples, and frontmatter
- Lets an LLM ingest your entire documentation corpus in a single fetch

```md
# API Reference: Get museum hours

URL: /docs/api-reference/operations/getMuseumHours
Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techwithanirudh/fumadocs-starter/refs/heads/main/content/docs/api-reference/(generated)/operations/getMuseumHours.mdx

Get upcoming museum operating hours.

...full MDX content...
```

The route (`src/app/llms-full.txt/route.ts`) streams the latest content on request—no extra build step is required.

## `/llms.mdx/*`

- Provides the raw MDX/Markdown content of a requested page
- Preserves headings, paragraphs, code samples, and frontmatter
- Returns `404` for unknown slugs and sets `Content-Type: text/markdown`

Example: `/llms.mdx/quickstart`

```md
# Home: Quickstart

URL: /docs/quickstart
Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techwithanirudh/fumadocs-starter/refs/heads/main/content/docs/(index)/quickstart.mdx

Start building awesome documentation in under 5 minutes

## Setup your development environment

A minimum version of Node.js 22 is required...
```

All three endpoints read directly from the same `source` used by the site, so updates to `content/docs` automatically flow into the LLM feeds without additional configuration.
