## Introduction

Large language models waste tokens crawling HTML, JS, and site chrome. By shipping a few simple endpoints, you can provide a more efficient way for LLMs to access your documentation.

1. **`/llms.txt`**: a concise sitemap with titles, URLs, and summaries
2. **`/llms-full.txt`**: a full Markdown dump of every document
3. **`/llms.mdx/*`**: the raw MDX/Markdown content of a requested page

## `/llms.txt`

- Lists each section and page in your documentation
- Includes optional one-line descriptions from frontmatter
- No boilerplate or styling, just the outline

```md
# Docs

## API Reference

- [Get museum hours](/docs/api-reference/operations/getMuseumHours): Get upcoming museum operating hours.
- [Buy museum tickets](/docs/api-reference/tickets/buyMuseumTickets): Purchase museum tickets for general entry or special events.

## Home

- [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart): Start building awesome documentation in under 5 minutes
```

This file is generated at the root of your deployed site, enabling agents to discover it at `https://<your-domain>/llms.txt`.

## `/llms-full.txt`

- Concatenates the raw MDX/Markdown of every page
- Preserves headings, paragraphs, code samples, and frontmatter
- Lets an LLM ingest your entire documentation corpus in a single fetch
